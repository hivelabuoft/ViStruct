# ViStruct Client

This is the frontend client for the ViStruct project, built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

## 📋 Overview

ViStruct is a visualization tool that connects with a FastAPI backend server for processing and analyzing visual data. The client provides an interactive interface for users to work with visualization structures.

## 🔧 System Requirements

- Node.js version 20.0 or higher
- npm version 25.0 or higher

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the client folder with:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### Development

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This uses turbopack for faster development builds. The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Building for Production

Build the application:

```bash
npm run build
```

Start the production server:

```bash
npm run start
```

## 🔄 Connecting to the Backend

The client communicates with a FastAPI server. To run the full stack:

1. Start the backend server first (from the server directory):
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
   
2. Then start the frontend client (from the client directory):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 🧩 Key Features

- Integration with Google Generative AI
- Monaco Editor for code visualization
- Axios for API communication with backend
- HTML to canvas conversion for visualization capturing
- Icon-rich interface with React Icons
